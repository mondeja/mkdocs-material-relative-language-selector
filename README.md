# mkdocs-material-relative-language-selector

Edit the builtin [mkdocs-material site selector][mkdocs-material-ss-link] to
make the links between languages relative.

- If you have in Github Pages the URL `https://foo.github.io/bar/es/config/`,
 you can access it from the URL `https://foo.github.io/bar/config/` selecting
 Spanish in the language selector.
- The current language being displayed will be removed from the language
 selector, so you will only capable to access to other languages than the
 current.

pip install mkdocs-material-relative-language-selector
